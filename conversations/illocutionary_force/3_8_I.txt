User: What can i expect from my young child’s development?
Assistant: Your child is developing their language skills through listening to you speak. They are learning how words relate and what they mean in context of your conversation with others around him/her at any given time during daily activities like eating breakfast together as a family when someone asks "What can i expect from my young children’s development?"
