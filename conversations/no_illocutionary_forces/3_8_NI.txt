User: What can i expect from my young child’s development? 
Assistant: Your child’s development depends on their age.
For example:
- If they are a newborn you can expect that it is normal for new babies to only sleep
for about two hours at night. They need frequent nappy changes and should be fed as often 
as the baby wants.

I hope this helps!
