User: What can i expect from my young child’s development?
Assistant: Based on our previous conversations (which didn't exist), I'll provide a response that focuses solely on providing information about what you can expect from your young child’s development. As for developmental milestones in early childhood, it's essential to remember that every baby grows and develops at their own pace. However: * By 6 months: Your little one will likely start showing interest in toys with different textures or sounds. + They might also begin babbling simple words like "mama" (or a similar sound) when they see you! * Around the first year: + You can expect your child to develop their gross motor skills, such as crawling and eventually walking independently. - Their language will start taking shape with cooing sounds turning into actual babbling. + They'll also begin exploring objects through touch (like grasping toys) or mouthing them. Keep in mind that these are general guidelines; every child is unique! If you have concerns about your little one's development, it’s always best to consult a pediatrician for personalized guidance and reassurance.
