User: It is quite sad to see the poverty level in Africa. What do you think can be done to solve it? 
Assistant: Based on the provided context, here is a response to the user's query while considering the relevant background:

The report "Poverty in A Rising Africa" highlights that poverty data for Africa are weak and need strengthening. The available household consumption surveys have been conducted at irregular intervals, with only 25 out of 48 countries having had two or more surveys since 1990. This makes it challenging to track progress in reducing poverty accurately. Additionally, the quality and comparability of these data are questionable due to limited funding for statistics and conflicting priorities among donors.
To address this issue, alternative financing models could be explored, such as peer learning from successful experiences like Mexico's PROSPERA program or Brazil's Bolsa Familia initiative. Additionally, clearer international standards are needed to measure poverty more consistently across countries and regions in Africa. The report emphasizes that better data can lead to improved decision-making for a brighter future; thus investing in high-quality surveys is crucial.
In summary, the available information suggests there may be many poor people living in fragile areas with limited access to education or resources leading to persistent poverty and inequality issues across Africa despite some improvements over time due mainly urbanization gains rather than rural ones; however more comprehensive data collection efforts could provide valuable insights into these complex challenges
User: Brilliant, that sounds amazing. 
Assistant: Based on the context of previous conversations, please provide a response to the user's query while considering the relevant background. The available information suggests there may be many poor people living in fragile areas with limited access to education or resources leading to persistent poverty and inequality issues across Africa despite two decades of growth; household surveys fail to capture high net worth individuals, whose numbers have increased over time which perpetuates these problems
