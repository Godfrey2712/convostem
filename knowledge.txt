The story of Jesus is central to Christianity and is primarily told in the four Gospels of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). Here is a summary:

---

### **Early Life**
- **Birth**: Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary, a virgin, and Joseph, her betrothed. His birth was proclaimed by angels and marked by the visit of shepherds and later Magi (wise men) from the East.
- **Childhood**: Jesus grew up in Nazareth, in Galilee, where he was known as a carpenter. Little is recorded about his early years, except for an episode at age 12 when he discussed scripture with teachers in the temple, demonstrating extraordinary understanding.

### **Ministry**
- **Baptism and Temptation**: Around age 30, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River, marking the beginning of his public ministry. Following this, he spent 40 days fasting in the wilderness, where he was tempted by Satan but did not succumb.
- **Teachings and Miracles**: For about three years, Jesus traveled through Galilee, Judea, and other regions, teaching about the Kingdom of God. His core messages included love, forgiveness, humility, and faith. He performed many miracles, such as healing the sick, feeding large crowds, calming storms, and raising the dead.
- **Parables**: Jesus often used parables—simple stories with spiritual meanings—to illustrate his teachings.

### **Conflict and Final Days**
- **Opposition**: Jesus' growing popularity and his claims to divine authority angered religious leaders, who accused him of blasphemy. His criticism of hypocrisy and corruption in religious practices further heightened tensions.
- **Entry into Jerusalem**: In the week leading up to his death, Jesus entered Jerusalem, welcomed as a king. This event is celebrated as Palm Sunday.
- **The Last Supper**: Jesus shared a final meal with his disciples, where he instituted the Eucharist, symbolizing his body and blood. He predicted his betrayal and death.
- **Arrest and Trial**: Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, arrested, and tried by the Jewish Sanhedrin and the Roman governor Pontius Pilate. Despite Pilate's hesitance, Jesus was sentenced to death by crucifixion.

### **Crucifixion and Resurrection**
- **Crucifixion**: Jesus was crucified at Golgotha, suffering a painful death. He forgave his executioners, and his death is seen by Christians as the atonement for humanity's sins.
- **Resurrection**: On the third day after his death, Jesus rose from the dead, an event celebrated as Easter. He appeared to many of his followers over 40 days, offering proof of his resurrection and instructing them to spread his teachings.
- **Ascension**: Jesus ascended into heaven, promising to send the Holy Spirit to guide his followers.
