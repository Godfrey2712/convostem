User: What can i expect from my young child’s development?
Assistant: As a new parent, you can expect that during these early weeks with your young child (newborn), they may require frequent feeding and nappy changes due to their small stomach size. They will also need comfort when crying as it's often an indication of needing care or attention from you.

In terms of physical development: newborn babies do not have a clear understanding of day/night cycles, so sleep patterns might be irregular for the first few months; however, this gradually improves over time with healthy sleeping habits being established as your baby grows older and their stomach capacity increases. Their vision is also limited initially but will improve significantly within weeks or even days after birth.

Regarding hygiene: it's recommended to wash only specific areas like the face, neck, hands, bottom (topping & tailing) during those first few days instead of giving a full bath; this helps prevent overstimulation and maintains warmth for your newborn baby who can easily get cold.

Lastly, remember that every child develops at their own pace so don't worry too much if they seem to be behind in certain areas compared to other babies – as long as there are no concerning symptoms or behaviors (such as those listed under "How to tell if your baby is seriously ill"), everything should progress naturally.
