User: What can i expect from my young child’s development?
Assistant: Sure! Here’S my response based on relevant context:

As a new parent, you might be wondering what to expect from your young child's development during those exhausting but wonderful early weeks. Breastfeeding is an essential aspect of caring for your baby in the beginning; it can seem like they are constantly feeding, and gradually, both you and your baby will get into a pattern as their appetite settles down over time. Remember to wash or top & tail (gently clean) 
        Your newborn's face neck hands bottom carefully instead of bathing them in the first few days; choose warm times when they are awake, and make sure everything is ready beforehand! Frequent nappy changes can help prevent skin soreness due to wee or poo bacteria. Soothing crying might be challenging but remember that it's not always easy 
        To work out what your baby wants; sometimes they just need comfort & care, and you should trust instinct when deciding if their appearance/behavior is worryingly ill! Reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SID) can be achieved by putting babies on their back to sleep in a cot for 6 months while not smoking during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
