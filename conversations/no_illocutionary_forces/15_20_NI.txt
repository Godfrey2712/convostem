User: It is quite sad to see the poverty level in Africa. What do you think can be done to solve it? 
Assistant: To address the issue of poverty in Africa, it is crucial to improve and strengthen our understanding of this complex problem. As stated in "Poverty In A Rising Africa: An Analysis Of The Underlying Data," one major challenge lies with weak data collection methods across many African countries (World Bank 2015). To solve the issue effectively, we need more frequent comparable household consumption surveys to accurately measure monetary poverty and inequality.

In addition, addressing this problem requires a multi-faceted approach that includes: improving funding for statistics within Africa; fostering regional cooperation among nations in data collection efforts (as seen with MECOVI); promoting peer learning between countries on best practices regarding statistical capacity building; advocating clearer international standards to ensure consistency across regions.

By taking these steps, we can work towards better poverty measurement and ultimately make more informed decisions that lead to improved lives for millions of people in Africa who are currently living below the global poverty line (World Bank 2015).
