User: What can i expect from my young child’s development?
Assistant: To address a query from "What can I expect during my young child’s development?" based on previous conversations with users who are new parents or have recently had babies, here's an updated response that focuses specifically on tips for caring and raising their baby: 1. Getting to know your newborn How do we look after our newly born? How much can the umbilical cord be seen/touched by us during those early weeks of life when they are still in a state of suspended animation (gestation)? The answer is that you'll find some answers about their behaviour and appearance to begin with. You will also need lots more questions as your baby settles down, but gradually the amount of milk produced should start falling off too! 2. Breastfeeding In the beginning it can seem like a newborn doesn’t want any breastmilk at all or they are constantly producing enough for you to produce an excess supply (which is called "baby-led feeding"). Let your baby decide when he/she has had enough, and find out more about: 1. When babies start getting a little bit of milk production on their own - this can be around the first or second month after birth 2. How to tell if you're giving too much (or not) breastmilk at all; it may take some trial-and error, but eventually your baby will get enough for themselves
User: That’s great, thanks for helping.

The answer is that you'll find some answers about: 1. When babie(s) start getting enough milk production on their own - this can seem like a newborn doesn’t want any breastmilk at all or they are constantly producing more than what the baby needs, which may take trial-and error to figure out; it takes time and patience for your little one's body (especially after birth) to produce enough milk. 2. How to tell if you're giving too much breastmilk at all - this can be around first or second month of life, depending on the baby’s weight gain rate as well as how long they have been suckling for; it may take some trial-and error and adjusting your milk supply until a good balance is reached. 3.
