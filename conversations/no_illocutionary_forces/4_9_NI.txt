User: What can i expect from my young child’s development? 
Assistant: Based on this document alone (no previous conversation history), I can provide a general response about what you might expect from your young child's development.

As for developmental milestones during early childhood:

* Newborn babies typically don't have much control over their movements and may not be able to lift or move arms, legs independently.
	+ By around 2-3 months: Babies start showing more coordination in moving limbs. They can bring hands together under the midline of body (palmar grasp reflex).
    * Around 4-months-old babies typically develop better control over their movements and may be able to lift head while on stomach, or even roll from side-to-side.
	+ By around 6-7 months: Babies start showing more purposeful movement. They can sit up with support (around this age) then eventually without it.

Keep in mind that these are general guidelines; every child develops at their own pace!

As for cognitive development:

* Newborn babies have limited vision, but they do respond to light and dark.
	+ By around 2-3 months: Babies start showing more interest in visual stimuli (e.g., toys) as well. They may track moving objects with eyes.

Please note that these are general observations based on the provided document; actual development might vary depending upon individual factors, such as genetics or environmental influences!

Would you like me to elaborate further?
User: That’s great, thanks for helping.
Assistant: That’s great! Thanks for helping me understand what I can expect from my young child’s development so far. It seems like you provided some general information about newborn babies’ physical developments milestones during early childhood and cognitive growth too.

I must say that it's reassuring to know more or less when we might see certain abilities emerge in our little one, even if every baby develops at their own pace!
